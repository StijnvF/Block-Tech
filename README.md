### Matching feature
During this project is started working on my first webbapplication. I called it "BijSmaak" and the concept is a feature where people get matched on basis of their favorite kitchen, and a couple of more standard thigs. This wil give you a profile wich you can then edit or delete from the database. I fully foccused on this feature of the application.


## Getting started
To install this project you will need to install node, if you already installed node skip to **Install project**.

### Install node
* In your terminal run the following code:
```curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.37.2/install.sh | bash```
* To check if the installation is succesful run ```nvm --version``` if a number is printed the installation was succeeded.
* Restart your terminal and run ```nvm install stable``` to install node.
* node is now installed. you can check this by running  ``` npm --version``` and ```node --version```

### Install project

## How to use
