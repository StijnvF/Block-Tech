## matching feature
During this project is started working on my first webbapplication. The concept is a feature where people get matched on basis of their favorite kitchen, and a couple of more standard thigs. This wil give you a profile wich you can then edit or delete from the database.
## Getting started
* Clone repository to your local directory using `git clone https://github.com/StijnvF/Block-Tech` .
* Install the neccesary packages with `npm install` .
* Create your own database with MongoDB to connect with.
* Run your server with `npm run start`
## How to use
* If you start the server you can navigate `localhost:3000` in your browser.
* From here you can follow the steps to start adding your profile.
