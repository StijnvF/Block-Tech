### matching feature
During this project is started working on my first webbapplication. The concept is a feature where people get matched on basis of their favorite kitchen, and a couple of more standard thigs. This wil give you a profile wich you can then edit or delete from the database.


## Getting started
* Clone repository to your local directory using `git clone https://github.com/StijnvF/Block-Tech` .
* Install the neccesary packages with `npm install` .
* Create your own database with MongoDB to connect with.
* Run your server with `npm run start`
## How to use
* If you start the server you can navigate `localhost:3000` in your browser.
* You wil find a butto that wil take you to the next step.
* Now you wild find a simple form to walk through and create your first profile.
* After creating your profile you wil find the option to edit your profile.
* If you want to edit your profile click the 'edit' button.
